			<h1>Video1</h1>
			<h2>
				<p>
				 We created this video as our final project for the Creativity and Visual Expression class.<br>
				Before explaining the video itself, let me first share 
				the inspiration behind it. Recently, on social media, <br>
				we noticed the coexistence of two contrasting phenomena. 
				On one hand, narcissism, where people express the desire  <br>
				to share their most perfect and beautiful selves with others,  
				and on the other hand, self-loathing, where people dislike themselves  <br>
				and are overly conscious of how they are perceived by others. 
				We found it intriguing how these opposing concepts could exist within <br>
				the same society, and that thought sparked the idea for our video.  
				</p>
				<p>
				 Thus, we decided to use a mask as a medium and made narcissism the main theme of our video. <br>
				In the video, the mask initially seems to serve as a tool for  
				the protagonist to love themselves too much, perceiving themselves  <br>
				as more beautiful and decorated than their actual appearance.  
				However, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that  <br>
				the protagonist is not seeing themselves honestly.  
				Instead, they become aware of their flaws and use the mask  <br>
				to cover them, focusing on how others see them, revealing  
				that they are just a persona adjusted to meet others' expectations.  <br>
				Additionally, by overlaying idealized images of eyes, nose,  
				and lips on the protagonist's face, we wanted to portray  <br>
				the desire to conform to society’s standards of beauty and  
				to project oneself into that ideal. We aimed to highlight  <br>
				the distorted self-love and, in the end, reveal that the protagonist,  
				like anyone else, is not truly honest with themselves, <br>
				yet still loves this version of themselves. 
				</p>
				<p>
				 Through this video, we hope to deliver a message of liberation  <br>
				from the consciousness of others to the audience. Although, realistically, 
				it may be impossible in South Korean society not to be influenced 
				by others' views, norms, and conventions, we wanted to encourage  
				people to take a step outside of that box. By not being overly concerned 
				with such constraints and by looking at themselves genuinely,  
				we hope to inspire a healthier sense of self-love.  <br>
				</p>
