				I created an Instagram card news to promote the booth concept <br>

				I designed a cover that fits the main concept of the portfolio. <br>
				The main colors were chosen to be shades of orange and blue, <br>
				and I created a sense of unity with curved lines and <br>
				irregular straight lines. To avoid monotony, the arrangement <br>
				and placement of these elements were slightly varied on each page. <br>
				A noise effect was added to bring visual harmony.

				This is the main cover of the portfolio,<br>
				 designed to highlight the core concept and the portfolio's title, <br>
				 'SEQUENCE.' The typography blends digital fonts <br>
				 with handwritten elements to reflect the portfolio's unique <br>
				 combination of digital and physical art.
