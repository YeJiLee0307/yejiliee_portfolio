			<h1>Gerbera</h1>
			<h2>
				(Mixed media on Kent paper)<br>
				The gerbera, a perennial plant belonging to the daisy family<br> and known 
				for its resilience to cold, has the symbolic meaning of <br>'An Unsolvable Mystery.'
				This flower was chosen as the title of <br>the work because the piece was inspired
				by a period of <br>self-reflection and introspection. As I portrayed myself in this work, <br>
				I found myself continuously contemplating my own identity. <br>
				After grappling with various uncertainties, I decided to conclude that,<br>
			    during this turbulent time, my sense of self was an unsolvable <br>mystery,
				an open-ended conclusion that remains unresolved.

			<h3>Gerbera_2</h3>
			<h4>
				(Mixed media on Kent paper, digital drawing) <br>
				This piece, created around the same time as the first one,<br>
				also carries autobiographical significance. When I paint portraits, <br>
				I believe the eyes determine the mood and meaning of the work, <br>
				so I approach them with the utmost care. In this painting, <br>
				I wanted to express feelings of confusion and being lost<br> by depicting the gaze looking <br>
				in different directions.

			<h5>Persona</h5>
			<h6>
				(Mixed media on Kent paper, digital drawing) <br>
				The persona, a concept established by psychiatrist Carl Jung, <br>
				is formed by accommodating the demands of those around us.<br>
				While it helps maintain harmony in social life, <br>
				it can also lead to losing one's true self. <br>
				The irony of losing one's genuine identity due to <br>
				the persona created to hide oneself is depicted in this work. <br>
				By attaching white gauze to the canvas, <br>
				I sought to express how people in modern society are concealed <br>
				by external forces, without regard to their own will.
