			<h1>Photo Collage </h1>
			<h2>
				
			This is a photomontage created by combining the first photographs I took with my dad's film camera, which he used 30 years ago. <br>
			The scenes captured through the viewfinder, seen through the eyes of a young man who was not yet a father, bring to life the memories of a time I never experienced, <br>filled with shining but clumsy youth. The photographs taken with the film camera convey the emotions and <br>
			feelings of that era as vividly as if I had hurriedly pressed pause on a video. Like my dad, I recorded these moments to pass on memories 
			to someone else. <br>That someone could be another person or even my future self.
