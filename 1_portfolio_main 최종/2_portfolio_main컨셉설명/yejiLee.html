			<h1>Main concept of my portfolio</h1>
			<h2>
				<p>
					When I first started planning my portfolio concept, I wanted to develop it around a central idea. I spent a lot of time brainstorming to find the concept that best represents "myself" among various abstract ideas.<br>
					 As a result, I decided on the main concept: "SEQUENCE." Just as dots come together to form lines, and those lines come together to create planes, the fragments of myself are expressed as sequences of moments. <br>
					 I represented the fading memories of the past, the ever-changing present, and the uncertainty-filled future as a series of continuous processes. The word "sequence," which can be described as a series <br>
					 of numbers or continuous moments, felt like the perfect term to archive my work. This concept reflects the fact that, while my portfolio may not be at an expert level yet, it represents my first steps<br>
					  toward becoming a UX/UI designer.
