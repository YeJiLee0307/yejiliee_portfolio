			<h1>Developing App</h1>
			<h2>
				<p>
					I want to develop an app that helps users alleviate minor inconveniences in their daily lives. The app is tentatively called "MiriAlight" (a combination of "Miri" and "alight from a subway").  <br>
				<br>
					    
				</p>
				<p>
					Inspiration: While commuting on the subway, I came across a statement saying, "Residents of Gyeonggi Province spend 20% of their lives on public transportation," and I wanted to address these everyday <br>
					inconveniences that people inevitably encounter. Given that there is a limited number of seats on the subway, passengers may have to stand for more than an hour at times. Predicting when seated passengers <br>
					will get off is a skill that students who commute develop. However, what if we could know when seated passengers are planning to get off? This could lead to a more efficient and less exhausting wait,<br>
					 which is why I am interested in developing this app.<br>
					 <br>


				</p>
				<p>
					The app would assign a unique number to each seat in the subway car. When a seated passenger inputs their intended stop, other users sharing the same server would be able to see this information.<br>
					 If such an app becomes commercialized, wouldn’t it lead to a better commuting experience?  <br>

			<h1>Using Arduino</h1>
			<h2>
				<p>
					I became interested in this field after seeing an Arduino artwork at the exhibition "[What Do Objects Dream?]" at the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art. I found it appealing that, <br>
					through coding, it’s possible to go beyond mere implementation on a monitor and provide users with an experience that they can feel in a three-dimensional space. I want to take related courses <br>
					at Art and Technology and work on various projects.
