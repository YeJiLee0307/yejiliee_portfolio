			<h1>Making my own portfolio_SEQUENCE</h1>
			<h2>
				I became motivated to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through <br>
				platforms like YouTube and Inflearn to create a portfolio.<br>
				Through this practice, I was able to gain knowledge <br>
				about front-end development and its basic principles.<br>

				Previously, I vaguely thought that the fields of design <br>
				and development were distinct from each other and <br>
				had only an interest in design-related areas. <br>
				However, through this project,<br>
				 I realized that a design-oriented mindset is essential <br>
				 in front-end development. <br>
				 I found it fascinating to create code <br>
				 that allows me to produce my own designs, <br>
				 and this experience has made me appreciate <br>
				 the fusion of art and technology.<br>

			<h5>Coding class</h5>
			<h6>
				By learning Python, which can be considered <br>
				the most basic programming language, I was able to grasp <br>
				the fundamental principles of computer languages.<br>
				 I was fascinated to learn that applications and websites <br>
				 like Instagram and Pinterest were built using Python code, <br>
				 and I realized that with this foundational knowledge, <br>
				 I could create similar applications and websites. <br>

				Through the process of solving code and debugging errors, <br>
				I became familiar with the syntax of Python. <br>
				I also learned how to visualize numerical data <br>
				as graphs and charts, which helped me understand <br>
				the principles of various diagrams used in different fields.<br>
				 This experience made me aware of how crucial visual imagery is <br>
				 in the process of conveying information.<br>
			</h8>

			<h9>Video artwork</h9>
			<h10>
				This is the first video I created as part <br>
				of the Creativity & Visual expression class project team assignment. <br>
				While none of us had professional knowledge <br>
				of tools like Premiere Pro or After Effects, <br>
				we learned how to use these tools to produce a creative outcome. <br>
			</h10>

			<h11> </h11>
			<h12>
				Initially, it was challenging to convey our intentions solely <br>
				through visual imagery and effects without subtitles or audio. <br>
				If we delved too deeply into details, the project became overly <br>
				explanatory and lost its appeal.<br>
				Conversely, if we presented it too abstractly, the intended message <br>
				did not come across clearly to the viewers.<br>
				 I focused on bridging the gap between both extremes.<br>
